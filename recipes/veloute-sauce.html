    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Smooth and silky velouté simply consists of roux and stock. 
        Many different sauces and dishes can be created from this classic, French mother sauce.
       </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups white chicken stock (approx.)</li> 
      <li>kosher salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>white pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To start the velouté, first melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the flour and whisk until fully incorporated. Cook the roux until it turns a blond color.</li>
      <li>Slowly add the stock, a bit at a time. Whisk and let it come back to a gentle boil each time before adding more stock. Add the stock until you reach a silky-smooth consistency.</li>
      <li>Once done, season with salt and white pepper to taste. The sauce may thicken slightly as it cools, so if you’re not planning to use it right away, you may need to loosen it up with a bit more hot stock before using.</li>
      <li>Velouté sauce can be used in many dishes, from soups to sauces. It goes particularly well with poultry and seafood dishes.</li>
    </ol>
