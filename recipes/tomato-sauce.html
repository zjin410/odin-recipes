    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In August and September, when tomatoes are at their ripest, make a batch of fresh tomato sauce. 
      At the market, look for the cracked, slightly bruised tomatoes sold at a discount. 
      The flesh of the tomato should be dense, sweet and blood red. This makes a very fresh- and bright-tasting sauce in a manageable small batch. 
      Take advantage of good tasty tomatoes and fill a few zip-top bags for the freezer.
      </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds tomatoes</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>  
      <li>1 garlic clove, halved</li>
      <li>1 basil sprig</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut tomatoes in half horizontally. Squeeze out the seeds and discard, if you wish. Press the cut side of tomato against the large holes of a box grater and grate tomato flesh into a bowl. Discard skins. You should have about 4 cups.</li>
      <li>Put tomato pulp in a low wide saucepan over high heat. Add salt, olive oil, tomato paste, garlic, basil and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a brisk simmer.</li>
      <li>Reduce the sauce by almost half, stirring occasionally, to produce about 2½ cups medium-thick sauce, 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and adjust salt. It will keep up to 5 days in the refrigerator or may be frozen.</li>
    </ol>
